# Entrance Checking System Design Document

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose

This document outlines the design and architecture of the Entrance Checking System, aimed at providing real-time entrance monitoring through facial recognition technology. It serves as a guide for developers, architects, and project stakeholders.

### Project Overview

The Entrance Checking System is designed to automate the process of identifying and authorizing individuals entering a facility using computer vision and facial recognition technology. It comprises a real-time facial recognition module, a customer information database, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for administrative use.

## 2. System Architecture

### Architecture Overview

The system architecture is built on three main components:

1. **Facial Recognition Module**: Captures and processes images in real-time to identify individuals.
2. **Database Module**: Stores and manages customer information and access logs.
3. **GUI Module**: Allows administrators to manage customer data, view access logs, and interact with the system settings.

### Component Details

#### Facial Recognition Module

- **Technology**: Utilizes OpenCV and deep learning models for face detection and recognition.
- **Process**: Captures video feed, detects faces, extracts features, and matches them against the database to verify identity.

#### Database Module

- **Schema**:
  - `Customers`: Stores customer profiles, including name, ID, and facial recognition data.
  - `AccessLogs`: Records entry and exit times for each customer.
- **Technology**: Uses SQLite for development and PostgreSQL for production.

#### GUI Module

- **Layout**: Features a dashboard for live monitoring, customer management section, and system settings.
- **Framework**: Developed using PyQt for a responsive and intuitive interface.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Hardware Requirements

- High-definition cameras compatible with real-time image processing.
- Server with sufficient processing power to handle the facial recognition workload.

### Software Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher, OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyQt, SQLAlchemy.
- Operating System: Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## 4. Data Flow

### Data Flow Diagrams

_Include diagrams illustrating the flow from image capture to database entry and GUI interaction._

### Data Processing

1. **Image Capture**: Continuous video feed from cameras.
2. **Face Detection**: Real-time detection of faces in the video feed.
3. **Feature Extraction and Matching**: Extract features from detected faces and match against the database.
4. **Decision Making**: Grant or deny access based on match results.

## 5. User Interface Design

### Mockups/Sketches

_Include detailed sketches or mockups of the GUI layout and key interfaces._

## 6. Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Ensures compliance with GDPR and other relevant data protection laws.
- Encryption of sensitive data in transit and at rest.

### System Security

- Secure authentication for administrative access.
- Regular updates and patches to address vulnerabilities.

## 7. Testing Plan

### Unit Testing

- Tests for individual components of the facial recognition, database, and GUI modules.

### Integration Testing

- Tests for the interaction between components and data flow correctness.

### Acceptance Testing

- Real-world scenario tests to ensure the system meets all user requirements.

## 8. Deployment Strategy

### Deployment Process

- Use Docker containers for easy deployment and scaling.
- CI/CD pipeline setup for automated testing and deployment.

### Maintenance and Updates

- Regular monitoring for system performance and issues.
- Scheduled updates for software dependencies and security patches.

## 9. Conclusion

This design document provides a comprehensive overview of the Entrance Checking System, covering its architecture, components, and implementation strategy. The document will be iteratively updated as the project progresses and further details are finalized.
